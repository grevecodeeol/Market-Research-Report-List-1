<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The VOC Gas Testing Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PID</li><li>Metal-oxide Semiconductor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The VOC gas testing device market primarily features two key types: PID (Photoionization Detector) and Metal-Oxide Semiconductor sensors. PID devices utilize ultraviolet light to ionize volatile organic compounds, offering high sensitivity and fast response times, making them ideal for detecting low concentrations of VOCs. In contrast, Metal-Oxide Semiconductor sensors operate by measuring changes in resistance as VOCs interact with a heated metal oxide surface, providing a cost-effective solution for broader qualitative assessments, albeit with lower sensitivity and specificity than PIDs.</p></p>
